In the heart of the 17th century, amidst the unforgiving waves of the Atlantic Ocean, a man emerged from the shadows of tyranny. His name was Kofi, a slave torn from his homeland and thrown into the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade. But Kofi was no ordinary man; he was destined for something greater.

One stormy night, the ship Kofi was imprisoned on was struck by a fierce tempest. Amidst the chaos, Kofi found himself tossed overboard, sinking deep into the engulfing darkness of the sea. As his consciousness began to fade, a strange luminescence enveloped him. It was the spirit of Ngalyema, an ancient deity of his ancestors, who bestowed upon him extraordinary powersâ€”strength beyond measure, control over elements, and unmatched agility.
