The sun hung low in the sky, casting an blue glow over the training base at Chiran. Kazuo Takahashi stood at attention, his heart pounding as Commander Haruto Sakamoto addressed the assembled men.

"You are all here because you have been chosen," Haruto's voice boomed, "to undertake a mission that requires the highest honor and courage. You will fly your planes into the enemy's ships and give your lives for the Emperor."

Kazuo looked around at his fellow pilots, seeing the mixture of fear and resolve etched on their faces. He thought of his family in Kyoto, of his mother's tearful goodbyes, and of his father's stern nod of approval. He had tried to grasp the honor in this mission, as the Commander described it, but doubt gnawed at the corners of his mind.
