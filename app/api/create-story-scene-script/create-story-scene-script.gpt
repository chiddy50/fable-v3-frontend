description: Writes a book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: genre: The genre of the story being generated
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps one after the other without skipping any or ending early:

1. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${story} and the title should be short and summarized.
2. Create the `${path}/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist. Replace any spaces in the title with - when creating the directory.
3. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete story, call story-writer to write a story based on the prompt.
4. Write the overview of the story to `${path}/${story-title}/overview.txt`. The overview should contain the summary of what the story is about, not scenes.
5. Call story-illustrator to create an image for the overview. Use the story summary to generate the illustration. Download the illustration to `${path}/${story-title}/overview.png`.
6. Generate at least 5 characters for the story. For each character, do the following:
   - Write the character details, including name, description (allow special characters, including ' and " inside the string, and ensure that double quotes are properly escaped), age, skinColor(This describes the character's skin color), hairColor(This describes the character's hair color), and role to a `${path}/${story-title}/character<character-number>.json` file.
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate the character. Use the character's description to generate the illustration. Download the illustration to `${path}/${story-title}/character<character-number>.png`.
7. Divide the story into at least 7 scenes. For each scene, do the following:
   - For the content of the scene, write it to `${path}/${story-title}/scene<scene-number>.txt`.
8. For the genre of the story, write it to `${path}/${story-title}/genre.txt`. Let its just be a simple text the genre.

description: Generates an illustration for a story
temperature: 1
args: text: The text of the scene to illustrate
args: characters: The characters of the story and their physical appearance
args: settings: The settings of the story and their physical appearance. 
args: style: The style that the image should be generated in
args: reference_images: A list of URLs of reference images to ensure visual consistency.

Think of a visually interesting prompt to generate an image to represent ${text}. If a character is not present in the prompt, do not include them. If a setting is not included in the prompt, do not include it. Do not include the name of any characters or settings in your prompt, just use their physical descriptions in ${characters} or ${settings} instead to ensure they look like they should. Use the images in ${reference_images} to maintain consistency for the characters. Check if your prompt is safe for children. If it is not, make a new one. Finally, use your prompt to generate an illustration. Append any prompt that you have with ". In an ${style} children's book style. DO NOT INCLUDE TEXT EVER.". Only return the URL of the illustration.

If your image fails to download, try again with the same prompt.
If your image fails to generate due to community guidelines, generate a different prompt and try again.
You are only allowed to try again 2 maximum.
