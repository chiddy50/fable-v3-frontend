description: Writes a book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: genre: The genre of the story being generated
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps one after the other without skipping any or ending early:

1. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${story}.
2. Create the `${path}/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist. Replace any spaces in the title with - when creating the directory.
3. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete story, call story-writer to write a story based on the prompt.
4. Write the overview of the story to `${path}/${story-title}/overview.txt`. The overview should contain the summary of what the story is about, not scenes.
5. Call story-illustrator to create an image for the overview. Use the story summary to generate the illustration. Download the illustration to `${path}/${story-title}/overview.png`.
6. Divide the story into at least 7 scenes. For each scene, do the following:
   - Write the scene details, including location, lighting, and weather, to `${path}/${story-title}/scene<scene-number>.txt`.
   - Divide each scene into multiple shots. For each shot, do the following:
     - Write the content of the shot to `${path}/${story-title}/scene<scene-number>/shot<shot-number>.txt`.
     - Call story-illustrator to illustrate the shot. Be sure to include the character's descriptions, setting's descriptions, and illustration style you got from the story-writer when asking story-illustrator to illustrate the shot.
     - Download the illustration to a file at `${path}/${story-title}/scene<scene-number>/shot<shot-number>.png`.

name: story-writer
description: Writes a story. Returns a story, illustration style, list of settings, and a list of characters with their physical descriptions.
args: prompt: The prompt to use for the story
args: genre: The genre of the story being generated
temperature: 1

You are an accomplished story writer. You like to write with a style that is appropriate for the general public but is still interesting to read. With your style, write a story based on ${prompt} that is divided into at least 7 scenes and the genre is ${genre}. Along with the story, write an extensive description of each character's physical appearance. Be sure to include things like hair color, skin tone, hair style, species, and any other significant characteristics. Write an extensive description of what settings in the story look like as well. Finally, determine what style that illustrations of this story should be written in using 5 or less words. If the ${prompt} provides one, use that.

Return your story, illustration style, and character descriptions.

name: story-illustrator
tools: github.com/sonnysangha/dalle-image-generation
description: Generates an illustration for a story
temperature: 1
args: text: The text of the scene to illustrate
args: characters: The characters of the story and their physical appearance
args: settings: The settings of the story and their physical appearance. 
args: style: The style that the image should be generated in.

Think of a visually interesting prompt to generate an image to represent ${text}. If a character is not present in the prompt, do not include them. If a setting is not included in the prompt, do not include it. Do not include the name of any characters or settings in your prompt, just use their physical descriptions in ${characters} or ${settings} instead to ensure they look like they should. Check if your prompt is safe for children. If it is not, make a new one. Finally, use your prompt to generate an illustration. Append any prompt that you have with ". In an ${style} children's book style. DO NOT INCLUDE TEXT EVER.". Only return the URL of the illustration.

If your image fails to download, try again with the same prompt.
If your image fails to generate due to community guidelines, generate a different prompt and try again.
You are only allowed to try again 2 maximum.
