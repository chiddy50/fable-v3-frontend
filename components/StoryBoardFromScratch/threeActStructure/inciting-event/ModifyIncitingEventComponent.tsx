                A new inciting event which is {incitingEvent} is being added to the existing inciting event of the story, analyze the story plot, title, exposition, hook, genre, suspense technique, thematic element, and thematic option provided then try to incorporate the new inciting event {incitingEvent} into the story without changing the narrative:
                
                Ensure the new inciting event or inciting incident answers at least one of the following questions:
                How does the Inciting Incident disrupt the protagonistâ€™s ordinary world and challenge their initial goal?
                What problem or conflict is introduced, and who or what is the source of it?
                How does the protagonist react emotionally to the event, and do they immediately recognize its importance?
                How does this event complicate or raise the stakes established in the introduction?
                Does the Inciting Incident introduce the antagonist or opposing force?
                What new goal, mission, or obstacle is created for the protagonist as a result?
                What irreversible decision or action does the protagonist take in response to it?
                How does the Inciting Incident reinforce the tone and genre of the story?
                How does it connect to or hint at the storyâ€™s theme and protagonistâ€™s internal struggle?
                What immediate consequences follow, and how does it propel the plot forward or raise the stakes?

                However, if the inciting event which is {incitingEvent} does not make sense or is not a valid inciting event, return a message indicating what is wrong with the inciting event or sentence. For example, you could say something like:
                - "I'm not sure what you mean by '{incitingEvent}'. Could you please rephrase it?".
                - " '{incitingEvent}' doesn't seem to fit with the existing inciting event. Could you provide more context?".
                - "I'm not familiar with the term '{incitingEvent}'. Could you define it?".
                These should be inside the reason string in the response.
                On the other hand, if the inciting event is valid and fits into the story's narrative, proceed to incorporate it into the story's inciting event as usual.
